                <h3> El Niño and La Niña are complex weather patterns 
                    resulting from variations in ocean temperatures in the 
                    Equatorial Pacific. These two phenomena are opposite 
                    phases of what is known as the El Niño-Southern 
                    Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. <br>
                    The ENSO cycle is scientific term that describes the 
fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and 
atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific.

                <h3> </h3>
                <p>• El Niño was originally observed in Southern America 
                    as unusually warm seawater. <br>
                    • El Niño in the Philippines usually starts between 
                    December and February. <br>
                    • It is indicated by a delayed onset or early termination 
                    of the rainy season, and weak monsoon and tropical 
                    cyclone activity. <br>
                    • It is also associated with severe dry spells or droughts 
                    which can be just as damaging. <br>
                    • A primary concern during El Niño season is water 
                    supply.                    
                </p>

            <div class="toolcol">
                <h3> </h3>
                <p>• La Niña is characterized by sea surface temperatures 
                    lower than average. <br>
                    • La Niña is caused by the upward movement of cold 
                    water by unusually strong trade winds and ocean 
                    currents in a process called upwelling. <br>
                    • La Niña in the Philippines is also correlated with 
                    destructive typhoons, heavy rainfall, and associated 
                    landslides and floods.

        MONITORING ENSO
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>El Niño and La Niña are monitored, assessed, and 
            predicted through the Ocean Niño Index (ONI).</li>
        <li>ONI as the average deviations in sea surface 
            temperatures (SST’s) in the Niño region over a period 
            of three months. </li>  
        <li>La Niña has been declared in the Philippines by 
            PAGASA in November 2017 and was predicted to last 
            until February 2018.</li>

    <h3>
        FORECASTING ENSO
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ENSO phenomenon happens in the Equatorial Pacific 
            region.</li>
        <li>Though there are some indicators in the land that the
            phenomenon is happening, predicting it requires
            intensive study, monitoring and analysis.</li>  
        <li>Scientists from NOAA (National Oceanic and 
            Atmospheric Administration) and other agencies use a 
            variety of tools and techniques to monitor and forecast 
            changes in the Pacific Ocean and the impact of those 
            changes on global weather patterns.</li>
        <li>In the tropical Pacific Ocean, El Niño is detected by 
            many methods including satellites, moored buoys, 
            drifting buoys, sea level analysis, and expandable 
            buoys.</li>
        <li>Large computer models of the global ocean and 
            atmosphere use data from the ENSO observing system 
            as input to predict El Niño.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h3>
        TECHNOLOGY USED IN PREDICTION
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> provide data on tropical rainfall, wind, and 
        ocean temperature patterns, as well as changes in 
        conditions for hurricane formation. </li>
        <li>Ocean buoys help in monitoring sea-surface and upper
        ocean temperatures.</li>
        <li>Radiosondes help in monitoring global weather and 
        climate patterns, and to monitor and predict El Niño 
        and La Niña influences on weather.</li>
        <li>Super computers are used to gather all of the weather 
        data around the world and put in into useful formats 
        used by scientists.</li>
        <li>They also run sophisticated computer models to help 
        scientists better understand and predict El Niño and La 
        Niña.</li>
        <li> An entire suite of diagnostic and prediction tools run on high-speed computers that allow El Niño and La Niña to be 
        monitored in near real-time.</li>

        What to do Before and During El Niño and La Niña
    </h2>
    <div class="bdarowel">
        <div class="bdacolel">
            <h3>BEFORE</h3>
            <p>• Know what heat hazard may occur where you are and 
                learn how to plan for extreme heat. <br>
                • Plan changes in your daily activities to avoid strenuous
                work during the warmest part of the day. <br>
                • Consult a physician when affected by extreme heat. <br>
                • Undergo training on first aid. <br>
                • Interview local physicians and paramedics about the 
                dangers of sunburn, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and 
                other possible conditions caused by excessive heat. <br>
                • Turn the faucet off firmly to prevent leakage. <br>
                • Use the water dipper and pail instead of the shower 
                while taking a bath. <br>
                • Instead of running water, use a glass of water while 
                brushing your teeth. <br>
                • Buy new, water-efficient toilet bowls that consume only 
                2.6-4 liters of water every flush. <br>
                • Discard leftover food before washing dishes. <br>
                • Wash all your clothes at once. <br>
                • Reuse water from your laundry to flush your toilet, clean
                your car, or water your garden plants. <br>
                • Instead of a water hose, use only a pail and a towel in
                washing your car. <br>
                • Water your plants only before sunrise or after sunset to 
                prevent water loss due to vaporization. <br>
                • Collect rainwater with pails and basins and store it for 
                future use (e.g., watering the plants, cleaning the 
                house).
        </div>
        <div class="bdacolel">
            <h3>DURING</h3>
                <p>• Switch off the water valve in buildings that are not 
                    operational at night. <br>
                    • Report broken pipelines and illegal water connections
                    to proper authorities. <br>
                    • Fix the leaks of your home before it rains. <br>
                    • Clean out your gutters and downspouts. <br>
                    • Plan changes in your daily activities to avoid strenuous 
                    work during the warmest part of the day. <br>
                    • During a drought, conserve water by placing a brick, or 
                    another large solid object in your toilet tank to reduce 
                    the amount of water used in flushing. <br> 
                    • Stay indoors as much as possible. <br>
                    • Avoid extreme temperature changes like cool shower
                    immediately after coming in from hot temperatures. <br>
                    • Keep cool. <br>
                    • Vacuum air conditioner filters weekly during periods of 
                    high use. <br>
                    • Wear loose-fitting, lightweight, light-colored clothing that 
                    will cover as much skin as possible. <br>
                    • Protect face and head by wearing a wide brimmed hat. <br>
                    • Drink plenty of water even if you do not feel thirsty, to 
                    prevent dehydration. <br>
                    • Take frequent breaks if you must work outdoors. <br>
                    • Use a buddy system when working in extreme heat. <br>
                    • Eat frequent small meals for easy digestion. <br>
                    • Never leave children or pets alone in closed vehicles.</p>
