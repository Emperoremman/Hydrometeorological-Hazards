        <h1>What is it?</h1>
        <p>Hydrometeorological hazards are processes or phenomena of atmospheric, <br>hydrological or oceanographic nature that may cause loss of life, injury, <br>or other health impacts, property damages, loss of livelihoods and services, <br>social and economic disruptions, or even environmental damages. (UNISDR) </p>

                <h3>Tropical Cyclones</h3>
                <p>Tropical Cyclones, also known as typhoons, are intense circular storms that originate over warm tropical oceans and have maximum sustained wind speeds exceeding 119 km per hour and heavy rains</p>
            </div>
            <div class="type-col">
                <h3>Thunderstorm</h3> 
                <p>Thunderstorm is a weather condition 
                    characterized by heavy rain and wind 
                    accompanied by lightning, thunder; sometimes 
                    with hail and tornadoes.</p>

            <div class="type-col">
                <h3>Flood</h3>
                <p>Floods are when water covers land that's normally dry, caused by rain, snowmelt, dam failure, or storm surge.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="type-col">
                <h3>Storm Surge</h3>
                <p>Storm surge is the abnormal rise in seawater level 
                    during a storm. It is produced by water being pushed  toward the shore by the force of the winds moving cyclonically around the storm. The impact on surge of the low pressure associated with intense storms is minimal in comparison to the water being forced toward the shore by the wind.</p>

            <div class="type-col">
                <h3>El Nino</h3> 
                <p>El Niño is a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. El Niño is the “warm phase” of a larger phenomenon called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="type-col">
                <h3>La Nina</h3>
                <p>La Niña is a climate pattern that describes the cooling of surface-ocean waters along the tropical west coast of South America. La Niña, the “cool phase” of ENSO, is a pattern that describes the unusual cooling of the region’s surface waters.</p>
