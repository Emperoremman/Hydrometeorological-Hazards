                    during a storm.<br> Storm surge is produced by water being pushed
                    toward the shore by the force of the winds moving
                    cyclonically around the storm. The impact on surge of
                    the low pressure associated with intense storms is
                    minimal in comparison to the water being forced
                    toward the shore by the wind.

                <h3>BEFORE</h3>
                <p>• Know the storm surge risk zones and identify safer 
                    grounds for relocation if necessary. <br>
                    • Stay off the beach when weather disturbances exists. <br>
                    • Ensure that everyone is familiar with the identified 
                    escape routes of the family to higher grounds. <br>
                    • Help establish evacuation plans and procedures. <br>
                    • Participate in the regular conduct of drills and exercises.

            <div class="bdacol">
                <h3>DURING</h3> 
                <p>• Immediately move to higher grounds upon detection of 
                    signs of a probable storm surge <br>
                    • Be alert of and stay away from steep, high coastal areas 
                    which are prone to landslides. <br>
                    • Switch off power supply. <br>
                    • Stay on the inland side away from the potential flow of 
                    water. <br>
                    • If caught in a storm surge, take hold of large boulders or 
                    tree trunks which can provide protection from the force 
                    of water or debris carried by the flowing water. <br>

            <div class="bdacol">
                <h3>AFTER</h3>
                <p>• Do not eat fresh food that came in contact with flood 
                    waters. <br>
                    • Drinking water should be submitted to proper authorities 
                    for testing. <br>
                    • Check damage of the house to ensure that there is no 
                    danger of collapse. <br>
                    • Check house of electrical damage and open live wires. 
                    Electrical fixtures should only be switched on after 
                    making sure that it is safe to do so. <br>
                    • Help clean all mud and debris immediately.
