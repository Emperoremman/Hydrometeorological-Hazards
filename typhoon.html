<h2>
Every typhoon is different and there are many   
factors that contribute to its development. 
However, the following is a general sequence of  
events that could occur during the development 
of a Category 2 typhoon (wind speed 96-110 
mph) approaching a coastal area: <br>
</h2>
        </div>

<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        96 hours before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        At first, there are no apparent
signs of a storm. The barometer is steady, winds are light 
and variable, and fair-weather cumulus clouds appear. 
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        72 hours before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        Little has changed except that 
        the swell on the ocean surface has increased to about 6 
        feet and the waves come in every 9 seconds.        
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        48 hours before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        The sky is now clear of clouds, 
the barometer is steady, and the wind is almost calm. The 
swell is now about 9 feet and coming in every 8 seconds.      
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        36 hours before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        The first signs of the storm 
        appear. The barometer is falling slightly, the wind is 
        around 11 mph, and the ocean swell is about 13 feet and
        coming in 7 seconds apart. On the horizon, a large mass 
        of white cirrus clouds appear. A hurricane watch is 
        issued, and the areas with long evacuation times are give
        the order to begin.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        30 hours before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        The sky is covered by a high 
overcast. The barometer is falling at 0.1 millibar per hour, 
winds pick up to about 23 mph. The ocean swell, coming 
in 5 seconds apart, is beginning to be obscured by wind 
driven waves, and small whitecaps begin to appear on the
ocean surface.      
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        24 hours before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        Small low clouds appear 
overhead. The barometer is falling by 0.2 millibars per 
hour, the wind picks up to 34 mph. The wind driven 
waves are covered in whitecaps, and streaks of foam 
begin to ride over the surface. Evacuation should be 
completed, and final preparations made by this time.  
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        18 hours before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        The low clouds are thicker and 
        bring driving rain squalls with gusty winds. The barometer 
        is steadily falling at half a millibar per hour and the winds 
        are whistling by at 46 mph. It is hard to stand against the
        wind.  
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        12 hours before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        The rain squalls are more 
frequent and the winds don not diminish after they depart. 
The cloud ceiling is getting lower, and the barometer is 
falling at 1 millibar per hour. The wind is howling at 
hurricane force at 74 mph. The sea advances with every 
storm wave that crashes ashore, and foam patches.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        6 hours before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        The rain is constant and the 92 
mph wind drives it horizontally. The barometer is falling 
1.5 millibar per hour, and the storm surge has advanced 
above the high tide mark. The sea surface a whitish mass 
of spray. It is impossible to stand upright outside without
bracing yourself.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        1 hour before landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        The rain becomes heavier. Low 
        areas inland become flooded. The winds are at 104 mph, 
        and the barometer is falling at 2 millibar per hour. The 
        sea is white with foam and streaks. The storm surge has 
        covered coastal roads and 16 foot waves crash into
        buildings near the shore. 
    </p>
</div>
<div class="signscontent">
    <h2>
        Landfall
    </h2>
    <p>
        The eye of the storm: Just as the storm reaches its
        peak, the winds begin to slacken, and the sky starts to 
        brighten. The rain ends abruptly, and the clouds break and 
        blue sky is seen. The barometer continues falling at 3 millibar 
        per hour and the storm surge reaches the furthest inland. 
        The winds fall to near calm, but the air is uncomfortably warm 
        and humid. Huge walls of clo9ud appear on every side, 
        brilliant white in the sunlight. At this point, the barometer 
        stops falling and in a moment begins to rise, soon as fast as it 
        fell. The winds begin to pick up slightly and the clouds on the 
        far side of the eye wall loom overhead.
