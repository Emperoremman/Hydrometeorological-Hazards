                <p>A thermometer measures the extent of a given 
                    substance's hotness or coldness. Mercury is one 
                    of the liquids which is overly sensitive to 
                    temperature changes. The mercury expands and 
                    rises in the capillary tube when the substance to 
                    be measured is warm. Instead, mercury 
                    contracts. That is, principle of thermal expansion.

                <h3>Mercurial Barometer</h3>
                <p>In a mercurial barometer, the atmospheric 
                    pressure balances the mercury column, the 
                    height of which can be measured precisely. 
                    Corrections and adjustments are made for 
                    temperature expansion of the instrument, 
                    gravity and latitude in order to obtain 
                    accurate measurements. Millibars, 
                    millimeters, or inches of mercury are the 
                    units of measurements of pressure readings.<br>

                <p>A sealed box (blue, sometimes called an aneroid cell) is built around an aneroid barometer, which expands or contracts with increasing pressure. As it moves, it pulls or pushes a spring and a system of levers, moving a pointer up or down the dial yellow.

                <p>A barograph is a recording barometer. 
                    The pen point that traces the pressure 
                    curve on the paper is made to move up 
                    or down by means of a series of levers 
                    attached to aneroid cells (metallic boxes) 
                    in tandem. The use of aneroid cells in 
                    tandem provide a more pronounced 
                    response to changes in atmospheric 
                    pressure than would be indicated by a 
                    single aneroid cell of the same size.

                <p>â€¢ A Pilot Balloon is a weather balloon 
                    lighter than air filled with gas. When 
                    used in conjunction with a theodolite the 
                    pilot balloon is used to determine wind 
                    speed and direction at different 
                    atmospheric levels. <br>
                    Theodolite is similar to a transit 
made by an engineer. It consists of 
a sighting telescope mounted in 
such a way that it is free to rotate 
around a horizontal and vertical 
axis and has graduated scales so 
that the rotation angles may be 
measured while tracking the pilot 
balloon.
