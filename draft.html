    <h1>What causes floods?</h1>
    <p>There are many causes of floods. <br>Some of the most common causes are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Temporary rise in or overflowing of streams, rivers, or 
            confined bodies of water</li>
        <li>Heavy and prolonged rainfall, tsunamis, and storm 
            surges</li>
        <li>Failure of manmade structures such as dams and 
            clogging of drainage systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Factors that influence Flooding</h2>
    <h3>Rainfall Intensity and Duration</h3>
    <ul>
       <li> Most flash flooding is 
the result of prolonged, heavy rainfall from typhoons or 
slow-moving thunderstorms. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topography</h3>
    <ul>
       <li> Flooding is more common in low-lying 
areas such as plains and deltas. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Soil Conditions</h3>
    <ul> 
       <li> Failure of manmade structures such as dams and 
            clogging of drainage systems </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ground Cover</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Runoff is high in urban areas since 
much of the ground is covered by concrete. Vegetation 
lessens runoff, as it absorbs water and improves the 
ability of the ground to take in more moisture.
</li>
    </ul>
