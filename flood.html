        <h1>What causes floods?</h1>
        <p>There are many causes of floods. <br>Some of the most common causes are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temporary rise in or overflowing of streams, rivers, or 
                confined bodies of water</li>
            <li>Heavy and prolonged rainfall, tsunamis, and storm 
                surges</li>
            <li>Failure of manmade structures such as dams and 
                clogging of drainage systems</li>

                    precipitation on a map. Radar can show the location of 
                    the intense rainfall cores and estimate the duration of 
                    rainfall.</p>

                    radar but have the advantage of high resolution and 
                    complete coverage over oceans, mountainous regions, 
                    and sparsely populated areas where other sources of

                    lessens runoff, as it absorbs water and improves the 
                    ability of the ground to take in more moisture.

            <div class="bdacol">
                <h3>BEFORE</h3>
                <p>• Find out the frequency of occurrence of floods in the 
                    locality. <br>
                    • Know the flood warning system in your locality. <br>
                    • If it has been raining hard for several hours, or steadily 
                    raining for several days <br>
                    • Watch out for rapidly rising water and help prepare the 
                    family for evacuation. <br>
                    • Switch off the electricity and lock the rooms after all 
                    have gone out. <br>
                    • Have a handy survival kit. <br>
                    • Use a radio or portable, battery-powered radio for 
                    updated information. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="bdacol">
                <h3>DURING</h3> 
                <p>• Stay calm and keep updated with the status of the 
                    situation and safely reminders on what to do and 
                    where to go in case of evacuation. <br>
                    • Do not attempt to cross flowing streams unless 
                    assured that the water is below knee high level. <br>
                    • Avoid areas prone to flash flooding and be cautious of 
                    water-covered roads, bridges, creeks and stream 
                    banks and recently flooded areas. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="bdacol">
                <h3>AFTER</h3>
                <p>• Report broken utility lines (electricity, water, gas, etc.) 
                    immediately to appropriate authorities. <br>
                    • Ensure that electrical appliances are checked by a 
                    competent electrician before switching them on. <br>
                    • Avoid affected areas. <br>
                    • Return home only when authorities indicate it is safe to do 
                    so. <br>
                    • Stay away from any building that is still flooded. </p>
