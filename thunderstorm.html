                    characterized by heavy rain and wind
                    accompanied by lightning, thunder; sometimes
                    with hail and tornadoes. It can last for 30 minutes to several hours. It requires moisture and rapidly rising warm air to
                    form.

                    that forms as the warm updraft meets the cooler
                     air above and produces the clouds <br>

                    become so massive that they block out most of the suns rays <br>
                    • Mass of droplets within the clouds are an

                    • Downbursts can form gusts called straight-line winds which can carry the destructive force

                <p>Clouds can contain millions of suspended water
                    droplets and ice particles which continuously collide
                    due to turbulent air currents.</p>

                <p>Collisions knock out electrons creating a negative
                    charge, while rising moisture that just lost an electron
                    moves positive charges toward the top of the cloud.</p>

                <p>While ionization occurs and plasma is being formed
                    above, the objects on the ground reach out to the
                    clouds by growing finger-like electrical discharges

                <p>The electrons surge down to meet the streamers,
                    creating lightning. As lightning strikes, the air around it is heated and
                    expands rapidly to the point that it explodes.</p>

                    • Be familiar with thunderstorm warning signs.<br>
                    • Remove dead or rotting trees and branches that could
                    fall and cause damage or injury.<br>

                    updated information.<br>
                    • Assist injured people.<br>
                    • Inspect your home.<br>

                    areas and downed power lines.<br>
